In order to balance time spent moving between disk, system memory (RAM), and graphics memory (VRAM), as well as the amount of those resources consumed, the default setting sends pipelines from VRAM to RAM when not needed, then reloads from RAM when needed.<br/><br/>If you set this to <strong>Unload</strong>, pipelines will be freed from VRAM and not sent to RAM when not needed. This will minimize memory consumption, but increase the time spent loading from disk.<br/><br/>If you set this to <strong>Keep in Memory</strong>, pipelines will never be freed from VRAM, and up to three pipelines will be kept available, elimining swapping time. This should only be used with powerful GPUs with <em>at least</em> 12GB of VRAM for SD 1.5 models, or 24GB of VRAM for SDXL models.";
